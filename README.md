# setup-kubeconform

A GitHub Action that sets up the commandline-based Kubernetes manifest validation tool [Kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform). The tool will be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases), installed, and added to the `PATH` environment variable automatically. All operating systems and architectures are supported for released artifacts.

## Using the Action

It's recommended to use the action as a single setup step. Subsequent steps can directly call the executable. There are no limitation to the options that can be provided to the `kubeconform` command. The following example shows its usage.

```yaml
name: Validate Kubernetes manifests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  kubeconform:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Kubeconform
      uses: bmuschko/setup-kubeconform@v1
    
    - name: Validate manifests
      run: kubeconform -summary -verbose .
```
